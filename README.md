# destiny

A reactive UI library for JavaScript and TypeScript

## Disclaimer

This is an experimental library. There _will_ be breaking changes. Code is still a clusterfuck and leaks memory like crazy. Use at your own risk.

## How to run:

1. install node
2. run `npm i` in root
3. run `node ./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --watch` in root
4. start a dev server (ex: `npm i -g http-server`) and open `/index.html` to view demo
